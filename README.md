# Crowdunding_ETL
This mini project involves creating a crowdfunding database. The instructions are divided into the following sections:

#Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames: Extract and transform data from a crowdfunding Excel file to create two DataFrames, one for categories and another for subcategories. Export these DataFrames as CSV files and save them to your GitHub repository.

Create the Campaign DataFrame: Extract and transform data from the same Excel file to create a campaign DataFrame. Export this DataFrame as a CSV file and save it to your GitHub repository.

Create the Contacts DataFrame: Extract and transform data from a contacts Excel file to create a contacts DataFrame. Export this DataFrame as a CSV file and save it to your GitHub repository.

Create the Crowdfunding Database: Create a table schema for each CSV file by sketching an ERD and then specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Save the schema as a Postgres file named crowdfunding_db_schema.sql, and save it to your GitHub repository. Then, create a new Postgres database named crowdfunding_db, create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys, and import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table. Verify that each table has the correct data by running a SELECT statement for each.
